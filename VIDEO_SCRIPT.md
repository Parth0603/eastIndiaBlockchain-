### **[0:15 - 1:00] BENEFICIARY ROLE - APPLY FOR RELIEF (45 seconds)**

**[VISUAL: Navigate to "Apply for Relief" button, then beneficiary signup page]**

**NARRATOR:** "Let's start with those who need help most - disaster victims applying for relief."

**[VISUAL: Fill out beneficiary registration form]**

**NARRATOR:** "Victims simply connect their crypto wallet and provide basic information - their name, disaster type, family size, and describe their situation. The system requires no complex paperwork, just essential details."

**[VISUAL: Show document upload and form submission]**

**NARRATOR:** "They can upload supporting documents, and once submitted, their application goes to verified reviewers for approval."

**[VISUAL: Switch to beneficiary dashboard]**

**NARRATOR:** "Once approved, beneficiaries receive digital tokens directly to their wallet. They can see their balance, spending history, and use these tokens at approved vendors for essential supplies like food, water, shelter, and medical aid."

**[VISUAL: Show spending interface and transaction history]**

**NARRATOR:** "Every purchase is automatically verified and recorded on the blockchain, ensuring funds are used appropriately while maintaining dignity and privacy."

### **[1:00 - 1:45] VENDOR ROLE - SERVICE PROVIDERS (45 seconds)**

**[VISUAL: Navigate to vendor signup and registration form]**

**NARRATOR:** "Now let's see how local businesses become part of the relief network. Vendors register by providing their business details, selecting their category - whether they're a grocery store, pharmacy, hardware store, or medical service provider."

**[VISUAL: Fill out vendor form showing business type selection and services]**

**NARRATOR:** "They specify what services they can provide - emergency food, medical equipment, construction materials, or temporary shelter supplies."

**[VISUAL: Show vendor dashboard with payment interface]**

**NARRATOR:** "Once approved, vendors receive a unique payment code and QR system. When beneficiaries visit their store, vendors can instantly accept payments through the blockchain system."

**[VISUAL: Show payment confirmation and transaction processing]**

**NARRATOR:** "The system automatically verifies the vendor's category matches the purchase type - ensuring a pharmacy can't charge for construction materials, preventing fraud. Payments are settled daily, and all transactions are transparent and traceable."

**[VISUAL: Show vendor transaction history and settlement summary]**

**NARRATOR:** "Vendors can track their earnings, view transaction history, and see their impact on the community - all while being part of a corruption-free relief network."

**[VISUAL: Select a campaign and show donation interface]**

**NARRATOR:** "When making a donation, donors can choose specific campaigns or contribute to the general relief fund. They can donate any amount using cryptocurrency, and every transaction is immediately recorded on the blockchain."

**[VISUAL: Show donor dashboard with impact visualization]**

**NARRATOR:** "The donor dashboard provides powerful impact tracking - showing exactly how their money was used, how many people were helped, and which categories received funding."

**[VISUAL: Show real-time transaction feed and transparency dashboard]**
